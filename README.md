# pub_sub

A lightweight and efficient state management solution for Flutter, implementing the Publisher-Subscriber pattern with minimal boilerplate.

## Features

- ðŸª¶ Lightweight implementation (less than 100 lines of code)
- ðŸš€ Zero external dependencies
- ðŸ’¡ Intuitive API with minimal boilerplate
- âš¡ Efficient updates with automatic subscription management
- ðŸŽ¯ Type-safe state management
- ðŸ“± Flutter-first design

## Installation

Add this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  pub_sub: ^1.0.0
```

## Usage

### Basic Counter Example

```dart
// Define your state
class Counter extends Pub {
  int _count = 0;
  
  int get count => get(_count);
  
  void increment() {
    _count++;
    notifyListeners();
  }
}

// Create an instance
final counter = Counter();

// Use in your UI
class CounterWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Sub(
      (_) => Text('Count: ${counter.count}'),
    );
  }
}
```

### Multiple Subscribers

Multiple widgets can subscribe to the same state:

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  return Column(
    children: [
      // First subscriber
      Sub(
        (_) => Text('Count: ${counter.count}'),
      ),
      // Second subscriber
      Sub(
        (_) => Text('Is even: ${counter.count.isEven}'),
      ),
    ],
  );
}
```

## How It Works

`pub_sub` uses a simple yet powerful implementation of the Publisher-Subscriber pattern:

1. `Pub` (Publisher) classes manage state and notify subscribers of changes
2. `Sub` (Subscriber) widgets automatically subscribe to state changes and rebuild when needed
3. Subscriptions are automatically managed - no manual cleanup required

## Best Practices

- Create singleton instances for global state
- Use `notifyListeners()` after state changes
- Keep state logic in `Pub` classes
- Use `Sub` widgets for UI that depends on state
